# Smart-Wallet-Tracking
Contains code to parse blockchain data, cluster wallets, and analyze their activity. 

The psuedonymity of the Bitcoin blockchain may provide insight into the behaviors of successful traders. Although several methods exist to further anonymize one's transactions, many also exist to do the opposite. Techniques from blockchain forensics and analysis can potentially be used to develop signals and/or filters from a wallet's (or a group of wallet's) trading activities. This project is an application of these techniques, with the end goal of identifying some edge hidden within the network.
